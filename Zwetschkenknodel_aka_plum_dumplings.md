# Zwetschkenknodel

## Meta

Zwetschkenknodel, an Austrian dish my grandfather used to love. Aka Plum Dumplings, aka Plumplings.

* Servings: 8-12, depending on size of plum
* Calories per dumpling: ???

### Utencils needed

* Fine grater, i.e. the finest side on a 4-sided cheese grater
  * Or a ricer
* A large mixing bowl, preferrably glass because you will be scraping it
* Slotted spoon

## Ingredients

### For the dumplings

* 500g potatoes
* 12 plums (may not use all of them, depending on size)
* 125g all-purpose flour
* 3tbsp wheat semolina
* salt
* 1tbsp unsalted butter
* 1 large egg

### For the coating

* 42g unsalted butter
* 50g plain, fine, dry breadcrumbs
* 50g hazelnuts (pre-ground if possible)
* 2tbsp granulated sugar
* 1/4tsp cinnamon
* Powdered sugar (aka icing sugar)

## Preparation - plums

* melt 1tbsp of butter in the microwave
* Measure 125g flour
* Measure 3tbsp semolina

## Cooking - plums

* Boil the potatoes for 25 minutes
* While the potatoes boil
  * Wash the plums
  * Pit the plums
    * Cut lengthways, but not from arse to elbow. Just enough to be able to reach the pit. Pull the pit out once you can reach it.
* When cool enough to handle, peel the potatoes and grate (or rice) them into large mixing bowl
* Make the dough
  * Sprinkle in 1/4tsp of salt
  * Add 1tbsp melted butter
  * Add 125g flour
  * Add 3tbsp semolina
  * Stir until most of the flour is worked in
  * Add the egg and incorporate with a fork
  * Knead briefly, until a sticky dough forms
* Make the dumplings
  * Divid the dough into 9 portions
    * Depending on the size of the plums, you may end up being able to make more or fewer portions.
    * Only go up to 12 if you want the pastry very thin. This makes it more difficult to work with.
  * Now may be a good time to boil a kettle ahead of the next big step, boiling the dumplings
  * Flour your hands, and flatten each portion to a flat circle
  * For each plum
    * Tightly wrap the dough around the plum, sealing the edges and shaping it into a ball
    * If the edge isnâ€™t sticking, dip your finger in water and wet the edge to close the dough around the plum
    * Be careful not to trap any air inside
* Cook dumplings
  * In a large pot, bring salted water to a simmer
  * Cook dumplings for 12-15 minutes in simmering water
    * You will know they are done when they have all floated to the top
    * Ensure that they do not stick to the bottom
    * While that is cooking, begin making the coating

## Preparation - coating

* Ground 50g of hazelnuts (or measure if pre-ground)
* Measure 50g of breadcrumbs
* Measure 30g of powdered sugar
 
## Cooking - coating

* Melt 3tbsp butter in a large pan
* Add the breadcrumbs and grated nuts
* Stir well on medium heat for 3 minutes
* Stir in the pre-measured nutmeg, and 1/4tsp cinnamon
* Turn off heat
* Continue stirring infrequently, keep a close eye
  * The residual heat can burn the breadcrumbs
* Remove dumplings with a slotted spoon, transfer to the pan and roll in the breadcrumbs
* Dust them with powdered sugar and serve

## Next time

* Consider adding granulated sugar to sweeten them. The source recipe mentions it as optional but I decided to try it without first.
