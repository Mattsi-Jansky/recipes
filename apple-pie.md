* A large mixing bowl
* Something to measure water
* A pie tray
* A rubber spatula
* Clingfilm
* Rolling pin
* Pastry brush

## Ingredients

### Dough

* 350g all-purpose flour
* 2tbsp caster sugar (substitute: regular sugar)
* 1tsp salt
* 230g of cold butter
* 230ml of ice cold water

* 1tsp ground cloves
* 2tbsp flour

### Egg wash (Optional)

* Egg
* Cold water

## Preparation

* Measure out the water, leave it with ice cubes in the fridge until cold.
* Clean your work surface (we will use it for rolling dough)
* Measure out the flour
* Measure out the cold butter

## Cooking

### Make the Dough

* Mix the sugar, salt and flour together in a mixing bowl
* Mix the cold butter in
* When thoroughly mixed it should resemble damp sand
* Sprinkle the ice water over the mixture and gently mix in with a rubber spatula
  * When finished a dough will have formed. You may not need all the water.
* Remove dough from mixing bowl, place onto work surface, pad it int a disk/cylinder shape and liberally dust with flour.
* Wrap it in clingfilm and place in the fridge for *2 hours*
* Meanwhile, you can prepare the filling...

### Make the Filling

* Peel all the apples
* Chop all the applies into ~1.3cm-thick slices
  * Firstly cut the 4 sides off and discard the core, then cut each side into slices
  * If they're too small they will turn mushy
* Add all apple slices to a large mixing bowl
* Add all the sugar
* Add the cinnamon, ground nutmeg and ground cloves
* Add 2tbsp flour
* Mix well with spatula

### Make the pie

* Once your dough has been in the fridge for at least 2 hours...
* Dust the worksurace with flour, unwrap your dough and place on the worksurface, dust the top of it with dough too
* Knead it a bit by beating it with a rolling pin
* Split the doguh into two pieces
* With the first piece...
  * Spread flour on your rolling pin
  * Roll out until it is very thin, around 30mm thick (See: https://youtu.be/-Vy12e0LjX4?t=149). It should be significantly longer than your pie tray.
  * Roll the dough around the rolling pin, then drape it over the pie tray unrolling from the pin across it. The dough should drape over either side.
  * Push it down in the corners of the tray to ensure that it's fully, evenly spread out
* Add the filling into the tray, gently pad it flat
* With the other piece of dough...
  * Flour both the worksurface and the rolling pin again
  * Roll the dough piece out flat, a similar thickness to the last piece
  * Lay this dough over the top of the pie tray
    * Or cut them into stripes to form a lattice
  * Cut any extra that drapes over too far
* Crimp around the edges with your fingers (See: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sJRY1vdCMkQ)
* Make several small holes in the top crust, gently, with a knife
* Optionally: Beat an egg with 1tbsp cold water and spread it over the top with a pastry brush
* Any excess dough can be used to make decorative shapes to add to the top
  * If using egg wash, wash the added shapes too.
