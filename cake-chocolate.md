## Meta

A simple chocolate cake recipe

* Servings: 9 (40 degree slices)
* Calories per serving: ~720

### Utencils Needed

* Springform cake pan, 9 inch
* Parchment paper
* Large mixing bowl
* Small mixing bowl
* Hand mixer (or stand mixer)
* Wire rack
* Something to spread frosting (a butter knife may do?)
* Grater (a fine one, like you'd use for ginger but here you're using it for chocolate)
* Something to measure liquid/volume
* Non-stick spatula
* Whisk

## Ingredients

### Cake

* 300g all-purpose flour
* 80g cocoa powder
* 2tsp baking powder
* 3 quarters of a tsp baking soda (aka bicarbonate soda)
* 1.5tsp fine sea salt
* 150g brown sugar
* 220g **granulated** white sugar
* 110ml of neutral tasting oil
  * Vegetable oil?
* 2 egg yolks
* 2 large eggs
* 1 tbsp vanilla extract
* 415ml whole milk

### Frosting

* 500g icing sugar sugar (aka powdered sugar)
* 55g cocoa powder
* Generous pinch of sea salt
* 110g softened, unsalted butter
* 60-120ml wholemilk to thin
* Plain or dark milk chocolate bar (or both)

## Preparation

* Leave the butter out to soften for ~1 hour before you start the icing step(at least 40 minutes if you're time pressured)
  * This is only needed for the frosting step, so if you forget you could do the cake bases while you wait for the butter to soften for the frosting.
* Separate 2 egg yolks

## Cooking

### Cake base

* Prepare baking tray
  * Cut out a piece of baking paper to fit your springform pan
  * Place the paper in the pan and grease the top of it
  * Ensure the mixing paper is flat and reaches the edges
  * Grease the edges of the pan
* Prepare cake mix
  * Sift 300g of all-purpose flour into mixing bowl
  * Sift in 80g of cocoa powder
  * Sift in 2tsp of baking powder
  * Sift in 3/4 of a tsp of baking soda
  * Add 1.5tsp of fine sea salt
  * Add 220g granulated white sugar
  * Add 150g brown sugar
  * Whisk until thoroughly combined
* Prepare custard
  * Add two egg yolks to small mixing bowl
  * Start whisking together
  * While doing so slowly drizzle in 110ml of neutral-flavoured oil
  * When it starts to get too thick add 1tbsp vanilla extract
  * Continue mixing in the oil until all of it is added
  * After all of it has been added add two eggs and whisk all of it together
* Add custard to cake mix and mix it together, should become thick and clumpy
  * DO NOT use a whisk for this step, it will be a mess! Use a non-stick spatula
* Heat 415ml of whole milk until it has just about begun to simmer, **do not boil**.
* Whisk the milk into the cake mix until it is thoroughly incorporated and very smooth
* For each half of the cake mix...
  * Pour into prepared cake pan
  * Stick it in the oven for 30-35 minutes
    * Inserted toothpick should come out clean when finished
  * Leave to cool on wire rack

### Frosting

* If necessary wash up the large mixing bowl
* Make powdered sugar mixture
  * In large mixing bowl mix together 500g icing sugar, 55g cocoa powder, and a generous pinch of sea salt
  * Whisk all together until throughly mixed
* Using mixer beat 110g softened, unsalted butter until creamy
* Beat in powdered sugar mixture in batches
* Once thoroughly combined begin thinning out with whole milk
  * Use 60-120ml, stop when it's thick yet easily spreadable

### Construct cake

* *Wait until cake base has cooled before starting*
* Place one cake base flat side up and spread ~230ml of your frosting on top
  * You may have to do this by eye. Remember that you'll need less for the rest of the cake than you think, don't put too little in the middle section.
* Spread it out evenly
* Add the other cake base flat side down on top
* Gently press down until it's well glued
* Spread the rest of the icing across the top and sides
  * Seal the edges completely
  * if the top looks a bit boring use a spoon to make waves in the frosting
* Grate the chocolate bar over the top, covering the cake frosting in chocolate flakes
