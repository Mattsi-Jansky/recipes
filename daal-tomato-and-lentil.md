    * cook for ~45 minutes until lentils are paste, stirring every 5 minutes
      * When stirring ensure it isn't boiling above a simmer, scrape bottom to prevent lentils burning

    * Place the lid on and close the pressure valve.
    * Put it on "curry mode" and wait 30 minutes or so until it's beeping like mad.
    * After relesaing the pressure and opening it carefully stir the Daal well to break up any remaining mushy lentils (use a silicone whisk if you have one).
