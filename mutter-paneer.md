## Meta

Mutter (peas), Paneer (marinated cottage cheese) and tomato curry.

* Servings: 5?

### Utensils needed

* Large (4L or more) pot (Or equally large wok)
* Frying pan
* Large plate
* Slotted spoon
* Food processor or blender

## Ingredients

* 300g [Paneer](paneer.md) (or as much as you got from making it)
* Vegetable oil
* 4tbsp Ghee
* 1tsp cumin seeds
* 4 cloves
* 4 peppercorns
* 2 bay leaves
* 1 black cardamon pod
* 3 large garlic cloves (or equivalent garlic paste)
* 2 small-medium onions
* 2.5cm ginger root (or equivalent ginger paste)
* 1.5tsp ground coriander (cilantro)
* 0.5tsp hot chilli powder
* 0.5tsp ground tumeric
* 225g chopped tomatoes
* salt
* 600ml whey (from making your [Paneer](paneer.md))
* 500g peas
* 0.5tsp garam masala
* 2 small green chillipeppers

## Preparation

* Chop the paneer into 1.5cm cubes, store on a large plate
* Dice **half** the onions, store in a container
* Cut the **other half** of the onions into quarters, store in a separate container
* Measure out cloves, peppercorns, bay leaves and cardamom into the same container as the diced onion
* Blend the quartered onion, garlic and ginger with 2.5tbsp water
* Measure the coriander, chilli and turmeric into a container
* Open the chopped tomatoes and measure them out(Or chop tomatoes if using fresh ones not from a tin)
* Measure out the whey water. It doesn't have to be terribly exact, but if it's drastically over you may want to get rid of some.

## Cooking

* Place paneer in frying pan w/ generous amounts of vegetable oil under medium heat
* Start timer
* 3 MINS
  * Remove the paneer with slotted spoon, place onto large plate
* Reset timer
* Place 4tbsp Ghee into pot, put under medium heat
* Add cumin seeds
* Start timer
* 1 MIN
  * Add diced onion, cloves, peppercorns, bay leaves and cardamom
* 2 MIN
  * Add the blended mixture
  * Stir constantly
* 5 MIN
  * Should be golden-brown
  * Add the coriander, chilli and turmeric
  * Add the chopped tomatoes
  * Add a pinch of salt
* 10 MIN (or until all the liquid has been absorbed)
  * Add **4tbsp of** whey water
  * **Stir frequently**, it will burn easily at this point.
* 15 MIN
  * Add **all remaining** whey water
  * Add the Paneer
  * Reduce heat, simmer
  * This step is supposed to happen when all water has been absorbed and ghee (yellow oil) appears on the surface. But in practice I find that difficult to do and just giving it 5 minutes is fine.
* Reset timer
* 10 MINS
  * Add the peas
  * Continue simmering
* 15 MINS
  * Using slotted spoon pick out bay leaves, cardamom and cloves.
    * If possible. Not a big deal if you can't find them, just note that someone may get a sudden strong flavour while eating.
  * Sprinle 0.5tsp garam masala
  * Serve
