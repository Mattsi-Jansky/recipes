# Paneer

## Meta

Homemade Paneer (marinated cottage cheese) recipe (and whey). The fundamental idea is to boil the milk and add separating agents that will separate the milk into **curds** and **whey**, and capture them separately with filters and bowls.

* Servings: ?

### Utensils needed

* Muslin (Very fine cheese cloth)
* Several plates
* Colander
* Large (2.5L+) bowl
* Large saucepan or pot

## Ingredients

* 1.9l Gold-top whole milk. Should be as high fat as you can possibly find.
* 6tbsp lemon juice
* Salt

## Preparation

* Measure out 6tbsp of lemon juice into a container
* Line the colander with your muslin and place it over your large bowl.

## Cooking

* Pour the milk into the large saucepan or pot
* Place under medium heat
  * **Stir frequently to prevent it from burning**, but leave the lid on otherwise.
  * Watch the pot like a hawk! It will create a real mess if it boils over.
  * Once you hear bubbling, remove the lid and check if it has boiled.
  * This may take a long time (20-30 minutes) because frequently stirring it, removing the lid and using a medium heat all cause it to take longer to boil. It's worth it to not risk burning the Paneer.
* Wait until the milk is boiling, then switch the heat off.
* Add the lemon juice and 0.3tsp salt, and stir.
  * You should see the milk curdle very quickly.
  * If it doesn't curdle, add 1tbsp lemon juice and a pinch of salt.
* With heat off, leave alone for 8 minutes.
* Place your muslin-colander-bowl construction into the sink
* Strain the milk through the muslin-colander-bowl construction. The liquid whey should filter through to the bowl, while the curds get caught in the muslin.
* Strain the milk curds with the muslin and place them on a plate.
  * Straining method: Gather up the corners of the muslin and twist them tighter until the contents forms into a ball and more water comes out as you squeeze it tighter
* Place the muslin and cheese onto a plate and shape it into a disc. Stack a few plates on top to add weight (such that the cheese still wrapped in muslin is sandwidched between plates).
* Add the Paneer to the fridge.
* If you want to use the whey for thickening soups/sauces/curries...
  * Measure out as much whey as you need for your recipe into a container.
  * Wrap some clingfilm around the whey container and leave in the fridge.
  * Pour the rest away.
* Once the paneer is cooled, it is ready for cooking. Can refridgerate in an airtight container for up to a week, or freeze for several months.
