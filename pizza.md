Preparation
===========

* Clean work surface beforehand
* Measure out 245ml Lukewarm water
  * Perhaps boil the water, pour it out then wait for it to cool until it is lukewarm

## Making Dough and First Proofing

* Add to large mixing bowl: 380g of 00tipo flour, 2 tsp sugar, 1.25 tsp fine sea salt, 1/2 tsp diastatic malt powder
* Mix it all in until thoroughly incorporated, use a whisk if available
* Using a fork, stir 1.5 tsp instant yeast into the 245ml Lukewarm water
* Wait for 2-3 minutes until water is bubbling
* Mix that water into the large mixing boul with flour mixture
  * Stir the flour mixture by hand as you're pouring it in, start slowly and only speed up when the dough begins to take shape.
* Mix it by hand until it starts to take shape
* Knead dough for 5 minutes
  * Avoid using flour because it will dehydrate the dough
  * Wet your hands because it'll make handling the wet dough easier
* Slide the dough around in circles on the counter with your hands either side of it, making contact with the countertop (See: https://youtu.be/5DZA85l868c?t=172)
  * This should form it into a top-heavy ball
* Clean any remaining gunk out of the mixing bowl
* Lightly grease the mixing bowl with extra virgin olive oil
* Place the doughball inside
* Lightly grease some plastic wrap and use it to cover the mixing bowl, such that the greased side is facing down.
  * This prevents the dough sticking to the plastic wrap if it happens to grow large enough to touch the wrap
* Leave to raise for 2 hours
* If you're planning to cook one today, start the oven heating with the pizza tray right now.

## Second Proofing

* In the small mixing bowl mix together the 75g cornmeal and 75g all-purpose flour
* Lightly dust worksurface with cornmeal-flour mixture
* Remove dough from mixing bowl and split into two pieces
* Repeat the sliding the dough in circles technique to form each piece into a top-heavy ball
* For each ball that you wish to save for another day...
  * Take a freezer bag, rub or spray oil around the inside.
  * Place the dough ball into the bag and seal. It can be kept in the fridge or freezer.
  * On the day you use the dough, move onto the next step:
* For each piece you'll be using today...
  * Generously dust a mixing bowl with the flour / cornmeal mixture
  * Leave the doughball to rise in that mixing bowl covered with clingfilm for at least 30 minutes
  * In the meantime prepare any toppings, make the sauces and then move onto cooking.

## Sauces

* Add peeled tomatoes, 2 cloves garlic, 2tbsp extra virgin olive oil, pinch of sea salt and large pinch of sugar to blender. Optionally add chilli flakes
* Blend!
  * This will make two lots of sauce, perhaps save some for another day.
* Make a garlic oil mixture with 60ml extra virgin olive oil, garlic flakes and a large pinch of salt. Optionally some chilli flakes

## Cooking

* When ready to use...
  * Choose a surface to work on, remembering that you'll need to move the pizza from here onto the pizza tray. A big chopping board or even just a plate would do the job. Don't leave it on your kitchentop worksurface because you can't pick up the pizza without damaging it.
  * Generously dust the worksurface with the flour/cornmeal mixture
  * Place doughball in center
  * Punch doughball down to flatten the center, then follow around edges pushing the center down flat but leave a slight bulge at the edge for the crust
  * Pick up the flat dough, drape it over your knuckles and rotate it around letting gravity stretch it out. Go slowly.
  * Add the sauce
    * Dollop one tbsp at a time, then spread evenly with the underside of the spoon
    * There will be gaps, that's fine
  * Add generous amounts of Mozorella
  * Sprinkle the Parmigiano Reggiano generously on top
  * Add your toppings
  * Place it on the pizza tray in your pre-heated oven
    * Keeping the base intact while doing this can be difficult
    * The best technique is to shake your worksurface (chopping board, plate) in quick short bursts to shake the pizza base off. Once a small bit comes off the rest should follow quickly.
  * Cook for 5 minutes
  * Switch the oven to grill mode, still at full temperature.
  * Grill for 1 minute
  * Remove from oven and _immediately_ apply the garlic olive oil mixture with a brush to the crust
